#Answer
"""
Yes, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller by default. 
This means, when a signal is triggered, the operations performed within the signal handler 
are part of the same transaction as the operation initiated by the caller.
Django signals are executed within the same atomic block as the caller's database
operation. An atomic block ensures that all tasks within it are treated as a single unit of
work, and that they all succeed or all fail together.

#Explaination
"""
I have defined a Django model 'MyModel' and a signal handler function
'my_signal_handler' that binds to the 'post_save' signal of 'MyModel'. Inside the signal
handler, we modify the 'name attribute' of the instance and save it back to the database.
We create an instance of ‘MyModel’ with the name “Original” and print its name before
and after saving. Then we explicitly start a new transaction using ‘transaction.atomic()’
and update the name of the object to “Updated” within transaction.
Since the signal handler modifies the same instance and is executed within the same
database transaction as the caller, modifications made by the signal handler are visible
within the same transaction. Therefore, the object name printed after save reflects the
changes made by both the caller and the signal handler, confirming that Django signals run
in the same database transaction as the caller by default.
