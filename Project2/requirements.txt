#Answer
"""
No, Django signals are not required to run in the same thread as the caller. But by
default, Django signals run synchronously in the same thread as the sender (caller).
However, Django also provides the option to execute the signal asynchronously by setting
the 'async' parameter to 'True' using the '@receiver' decorator. When a signal is executed
asynchronously, it runs in a separate thread or process, allowing the caller to continue its
execution without waiting for the signal handler to finish.

#Explaination
"""
I have defined a Django model ‘MyModel’ and a signal handler function
‘my_signal_handler’ connected to the ‘post_save’ signal of ‘MyModel’. Inside the signal
handler, we simulate a delay of 2 sec in task execution using ‘time.sleep(2).
After creating an instance of 'MyModel', I have printed "Object Created" followed by the
thread ID using 'threading.get_ident()'. This allows us to compare the thread ID of the
main thread with the thread ID inside the signal handler.
When we run this code, we'll notice that both the main thread and the thread inside the
signal handler have the same thread ID, indicating that the signal handler is executed in the
same thread as the caller (main thread). Additionally, we'll observe that the print statement
"Signal handler finished" is printed after a delay of 2 seconds, demonstrating that the
signal handler blocks the execution until it completes its task.
